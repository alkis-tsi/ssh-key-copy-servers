### ssh-key-copy-servers
Remotely copies a user's public key from a 'master or jumpbox' server to the hosts-servers that has access to. 

#### Requirements
You will need to replace the public key with your user's one or the one that are interested to copy across.

#### Usage
Clone the repository or copy and paste the .sh file on your local machine. Make it executable and run it:
```
$ sudo chmod a+x ssh-keys-copy.sh
$ ./ssh-keys-copy.sh
```

#### Future work
Adding the user on the remote server
